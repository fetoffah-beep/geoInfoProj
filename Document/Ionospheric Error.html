		<h5> IONOSPHERIC CORRECTION </h5>
		
		GNSS Point positioning involves measurement of the signals emitted by a satellite for the determination of the position of a receiver on the surface of the Earth. The signal propagation through the atmosphere is delayed by the presence of free electrons in the ionosphere (about 100 and 1000 km altitude) and the water vapour content of the troposphere. These delays affect the precision in the estimated position of a receiver. However, for a double frequency receiver, the combination of both L1 and L2 frequencies of the signals resolves the effects of the ionosphere.
