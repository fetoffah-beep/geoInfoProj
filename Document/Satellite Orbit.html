		<h5> ORBIT MAP </h5>

		From the ephemerides, position and velocity of a satellite can be computed up to a valid range in time of 2 hours. Satellite ephemerides are extracted from navigation messages sent out by satellites. For every entry in the navigation message of a particular satellite, the software estimates its coordinates up to a time of 2 hours. By combining this dataset, it's possible to visualize the shape of the orbit.
