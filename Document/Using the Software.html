	<p>
		The <b>OPEN</b> menu item provides access to the file directory (see Figure below) for opening an LNAV RINEX file. When the file is not of the GPS navigation type, an error message is printed to the user, as shown in Figure 3, defining the error and by closing the dialog, the user can select the required file type.

	<h3>Satellite Orbit</h3>
	<p>
		This is the initial panel for the orbit visualization. From here, you can choose between 2 preferable modes, Global or Local Map.
	</p>


	<center>

	</center>

	<p>
		By selecting Global Map , you can insert the PRN number of the satellite you wants to visualize and click on the ‘proceed’ button. This will produce the map of the orbit.
	</p>

	<p>
		By switching to Local Map, the number of parameters to insert changes. In addition to the SV PRN number, boxes to enter the position of the reference point in geodetic coordinates are added on the screen. From here, it is possible to produce the trend of the azimuth and elevation in time with respect to the inserted parameters.
	</p>

	<h3>Ionosphere Tab</h3>

	<p>
		On this panel, you can select also a preferred model (Global Map or Local Map).
	</p>

	<center>

	</center>

	<p>
		By selecting the Global Map, the panel is updated, exposing the buttons for inserting the required parameters (time, elevation and azimuth).  The default time values are zeros and the user can change the values. Also, only numerical values can be entered in each button. By clicking on the ‘Proceed’ button, an Ionospheric Error map is produced showing the variations in the ionospheric effects on the globe.
	</p>

	<p>
		By selecting the Local Map, the panel is also updated, exposing the buttons for inserting the parameters (time, longitude and latitude) required for the model. Also, the default time values are zeros and the user can change the values. By clicking on the ‘Proceed’ button, an Ionospheric Error map is produced showing the variations in the ionospheric effects on the globe.
	</p>

	<p>
		In both instances of Global or Local Map analysis, when a GPS Navigation message file has not been selected, you are informed of the unavailability of the RINEX file and given a guide to select the file.
	</p>

	Also, when a file is selected and there are no ionospheric error correction parameters in the file, you will also be informed of such and can select another file.
