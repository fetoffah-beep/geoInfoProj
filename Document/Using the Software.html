	The Open menu item is needed to open a GPS Navigation message file (.rnx) before the main functionalities can be 
	accessed.

	The Satellite Orbit item gives navigation to the Orbit panel.

	The Ionospheric Model navigates to the Ionosphere panel where the paramters needed for performing the Ionosphere computation are needed. On this panel, the user selects the preferred model (Station analysis or Globe analysis).

	By selecting the Globe aanalysis, the panel is updated, exposing the buttons for inserting the paramters (time, elevation and azimuth). The default values in the buttons are zeros and the user can change the values. Also, only numerical values can be entered in each button. By clicking on the ‘Proceed’ button, an Ionospheric Error map is produced showing the variations in the ionospheric effects on the globe.

	By selecting the station analysis, the panel is also updated, exposing the buttons for inserting the parameters (time, longitude and latitude) required for the model. Also, the default values in the buttons are zeros and the user can change the values. By clicking on the ‘Proceed’ button, an Ionospheric Error map is produced showing the variations in the ionospheric effects on the globe.
